    <p class="light-text">Software Development Society / June 2019 - Present</p>
    <p>In this role I get to conceptualise, create and oversee new creative endeavours of the society through graphics and media. Having also been part of the team to set up the society whilst following the Student Union processes, guidelines and standards. With this it was great to have had the chance envision and develop ideas in order to establish the branding of the society from the logo to the design of the official website. It was also fun to have produced visual assets for the advertising campaign of Hacktoberfest 2019 hosted by both DEV.SOC and IT Society.</p>

    <p class="light-text">HackPompey / November 2nd - 3rd 2019</p>
    <p>For this weekend I decided to help arrange and distribute breakfast and lunch, as well as help clean up of the event. Being a volunteer it was key for me to present myself as a friendly point of contact for attendants at the venue. This allowed me to support attendants with my knowledge and skills in applicable areas to help them develop ideas. The silver lining to this was when I was able to help a group achieve their goals over the weekend, helping them finish any further front-end tasks in their computer vision application ready for presentation.</p>
