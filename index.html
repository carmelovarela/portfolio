                <h4>Profile</h4>
                <p>
                    I am a self-motivated Computer Science, second-year university
                    student, currently searching for Software Engineering / Development
                    12-month placement roles as I am looking for opportunities to work
                    within a driven environment where I will acquire new skills. I have
                    a proactive mindset which enables me to learn and adapt to different
                    situations whilst allowing myself to work efficiently by maintaining
                    both patience and a positive attitude towards work and people. My
                    enthusiasm for work also allows me to become very responsible
                    especially in times where I must work with others as part of the
                    team to organise and execute various tasks.

                <p>
                    In this role, I get to work on several projects to conceptualise,
                    create and oversee new creative endeavours of the society through
                    graphics and media. It has been a great journey so far, having also
                    been part of the team to set up the society whilst following the
                    Student Union processes and procedures. This role has enhanced my
                    abilities to envision and develop ideas rapidly such as in the
                    establishment of the branding of the society from the logo to the
                    design of the official website. In my most recent work, I have
                    produced assets for the advertising campaign of Hacktoberfest 2019
                    hosted by both Dev Soc and IT Society.

                    Present self as a friendly point of contact for attendants at the
                    venue. Help arrange and distribute breakfast and lunch, as well as
                    help clean up of the event. Supporting attendants with knowledge and
                    skills in applicable areas to help develop ideas allowed me to help
                    a group achieve their goals over the weekend, helping them finish
                    any further front-end tasks in their computer vision application
                    ready for presentation
