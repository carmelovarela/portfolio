    <h5 class="header">Hi</h5>
    <p>I am a Computer Science university student currently working as an Assistant Project Management Intern at Philips. I have a proactive and self-critical mindset which enables me to learn, adapt and improve within different situations. This allows me to work efficiently by maintaining both patience and a positive attitude towards work and people. My enthusiasm for work also allows me to become very responsible especially in times where I must work with others as part of the team to organise, execute and present various tasks.</p>

    <h5 class="header">Interests</h5>
    <h6 class="header">Digital Asset Design</h6>
    <p>From user-interface design to graphics such as advertisement banners and logos, this hobby helps me develop my proficiency in using programs such as Adobe XD and extend my knowledge of the different methods and techniques standardly used (e.g. Typography, Alignment, etc.), as well as learn new styles marketed from current trends.</p>
    <h6 class="header">Freelancing</h6>
    <p>Having freelanced many times for friends, family and clients. This has allowed me to diversify and extend my skills technically as well as improve my abilities to present and communicate in both formal and informal environments.</p>
    <h6 class="header">Outdoor Activities</h6>
    <p>Going to the gym and exploring new places provides a platform for me to be sociable and meet new people and helps me maintain a balance between work and social life as well as support my mental wellbeing.</p>
