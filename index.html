    <h5 class="header">About Me</h5>
    <p>I am a Computer Science, second-year university student committed to acquiring essential industrial experience, in hope of gaining an opportunity to work within an innovative environment where I will acquire new skills not only as an aspiring professional but as a person. I have a proactive and self-critical mindset which enables me to learn, adapt and improve within different situations whilst allowing myself to work efficiently by maintaining both patience and a positive attitude towards work and people. My enthusiasm for work also allows me to become very responsible especially in times where I must work with others as part of the team to organise, execute and present various tasks.</p>
